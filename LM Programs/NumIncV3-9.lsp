;;  The sequential text can be created using Text, MText or Attributed Blocks; furthermore, the  ;;
;;  style and formatting of these objects can be altered directly from the main dialog, with     ;;
;;  all settings remembered between drawing sessions.                                            ;;
;;                                                                                               ;;
;;  The user can modify the Text or Block layer, choose from a list of available Text Styles in  ;;
;;  the drawing, alter the Text or MText alignment, and also change the Text Height by either    ;;
;;  entering an arbitrary value, picking a value from the drawing, or using the height defined   ;;
;;  by the selected Text Style.                                                                  ;;

;;  The user also has control over which attribute will house the incrementing string, and the   ;;
;;  scale at which the block is inserted. This scale value can take an arbitrary value entered   ;;
;;  by the user or picked from the drawing, or can be dependent upon the current value of a      ;;
;;  selected System Variable, such as DIMSCALE.                                                  ;;

;;  If MText is selected, the user may also toggle the use of an MText Background Mask and       ;;

;;  The user can enter optional Prefix, Middle and Suffix text, and has the option to increment  ;;
;;  any or all sections, with the ability to increment alphabetical text and use decimals and    ;;
;;  leading zeros. The user can also specify any numerical increment, positive or negative.      ;;
;;                                                                                               ;;
;;  If the user has chosen to use Text or MText objects in which to house the incremental text,  ;;
;;  there is an additional option to enclose such objects with a border. The border may be       ;;
;;  Circular, Rectangular, Slot or an n-sided Polygon; created on a layer chosen from the main   ;;
;;  dialog.                                                                                      ;;

;;  The size of the border may be controlled using an Offset Factor from the Text or MText       ;;
;;  object. The Offset Factor has behaviour identical to that of the Background Mask Offset      ;;
;;  Factor wherein the offset is dependent upon the text height: an offset factor of 1.0         ;;
;;  exactly fits the Text or MText object, a factor of 1.5 extends the border by 0.5 times the   ;;
;;  text height etc. Alternatively, the user may specify a fixed border size, with the option    ;;
;;  to pick either dimension from the drawing.                                                   ;;

;;  Upon enabling the option to 'Create Array' (located towards the base of the centre panel of  ;;
;;  the dialog), the user can specify the number of items in the array and furthermore control   ;;
;;  the rotation of each object in the array, either relative to the direction of the array,     ;;
;;  or by entering a fixed value or picking such value from the drawing.                         ;;
;;                                                                                               ;;
;;  After submitting the desired dialog settings, the user is then prompted to specify a base    ;;
;;  point for the array. This is the point at which the first object in the array will be        ;;
;;  created and the point from which the array will emanate.                                     ;;

;;  Following the valid specification of an array base point, the user is given the option to    ;;
;;  supply either an array spacing vector, or the array endpoint.                                ;;
;;                                                                                               ;;
;;  The array spacing vector describes the vector between each successive object in the array.   ;;
;;  Conversely, the array endpoint specifies the point at which the last object in the array     ;;
;;  will be inserted; with the remaining objects inserted equispaced between the two points.     ;;
;;                                                                                               ;;
;;  Concerning object rotation, the user has three options to determine how objects are          ;;
;;  oriented relative to the array. If the user decides to align objects in the direction of     ;;
;;  the array, the rotation of each object will reflect the direction of the array vector.       ;;
;;                                                                                               ;;
;;  Similarly, selecting to rotate objects perpendicular to the array will result in objects     ;;
;;  oriented at right-angles to the array direction, whilst retaining readability.               ;;
;;                                                                                               ;;

;;                       and Text Alignment is set to 'Left', then the Object type is switched   ;;
;;                       to 'MText'.                                                             ;;

;;                    -  Added the ability to create an array of incrementing Text, MText or     ;;

;;                       the array, or with rotation set to an arbitrary angle.                  ;;
;;                    -  Included set of controls within the Formatting section of the dialog    ;;

;;                       System Variable.                                                        ;;
;;                    -  Provided the user the option to pick the Text Height value from the     ;;
;;                       drawing.                                                                ;;
;;                    -  Redesigned all object selection and pick buttons to conform with        ;;

;;                    -  Added the ability to increment the string during placement by pressing  ;;

;;                    -  Text & MText Border Offset is now a factor of text height where an      ;;
;;                       offset factor of 1.0 exactly fits the Text or MText object, a factor    ;;
;;                       of 1.5 extends the border by 0.5 times the text height etc. This        ;;
;;                       emulates the behaviour of the MText Background Mask, to enable the      ;;
;;                       user to easily create a rectangular border around the background mask   ;;
;;                       by specifying the same offset factor for both. This to me seemed        ;;
;;                       more intuitive.                                                         ;;
;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------;;

;;                       the program to error.                                                   ;;

;;                       object placement.                                                       ;;
;;                    -  numinc:writeconfig & numinc:tostring functions rewritten.               ;;
;;                    -  numinc:gettextbox rewritten and numinc:createtextborder function        ;;
;;                       updated to fix border elevation bug.                                    ;;
;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------;;
;;  3.5:  2014-04-13  -  Minor update to fix a reported intermittent bug causing the program to  ;;

;;                       with dynamic mode enabled.                                              ;;
;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------;;
;;  3.6:  2015-02-09  -  Minor update to fix a bug causing the program to crash when selecting   ;;
;;                       the 'Fixed' border option with a 'Slot' or 'Rectangle' border.          ;;
;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------;;
;;  3.7:  2015-03-22  -  Minor update to set dialog initial focus and allow the user to dismiss  ;;
;;                       the program dialog by pressing ENTER at any time.                       ;;
;;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------;;
;;  3.8:  2015-06-13  -  Program modified to allow the user to replace the text content of       ;;
;;                       primary & nested text, mtext, single-line & multiline attributes,       ;;

;;                    -  If the target attributed block contains more than one attribute, the    ;;
;;                       user will be prompted to specify the tag of the attribute whose value   ;;
;;                       is to be replaced.                                                      ;;
